    <h1>Checkout Reminder</h1>
    <p>We hope you had a delightful and memorable stay with us. As your visit comes to a close, please take a moment to review our checkout guidelines:</p>

    <h2 class="key-title">Time: 10:00 AM</h2>
    <p><strong>Please adhere to this time so we can prepare for our next guest.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="key-title">Before You Leave:</h2>
    <p><strong>Secure the Premises:</strong></p>

    <p>Close and securely lock the gate, and put the key set in keybox using your access code.</p>

    <p><strong>Optional Request:</strong></p>

    <p>If possible, kindly leave the space neat and tidy by folding the sheets and taking care of any garbage. Your effort is always greatly appreciated by the persons in charge of the cleaning.</p>
  
    <h2 class="key-title key-purple">Key - Purple Ring</h2>
    <p><strong>The purple key opens the downstairs bedroom.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="key-title key-green">Key - Green Ring</h2>
    <p><strong>The green key opens both upstairs doors (bedrooms and bathroom).</strong></p>

    <h2>Enter the Living Room</h2>
    <p>To enter, use the blue key to unlock the living room door. On the small table inside, youâ€™ll find the second set of keysâ€”welcome home!</p>

    <h2>Key Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To lock and unlock the living room door, pull it firmly towards you and lift the handle up before turning the key.</li>
        <li>The same applies to the kitchen door and the downstairs bedroom door.</li>
        <li>Upstairs doors do not require lifting the handle to lock them.</li>
        <li>To open the front gate from outside, turn the key twice.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have any questions, feel free to call or message us.</p>
    <p>Enjoy your stay! ðŸ˜Š</p>
    <p>Phil</p>
