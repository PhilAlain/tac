# Parking options
## Private parking ##

**Zenpark**

Visit https://zenpark.com/, a website where you can rent a private parking space for a few days.
They have many parking spaces throughout Paris, and some spots are available just a few streets away from our house.
(5 minutes walk, at the corner of Rue du Château des Rentiers and Rue Marcel Duchamp).
The cost is approximately €20 per day, and it's probably the best option.
You enter the parking with their application.

I recommend their parking at 46 Rue du Chateau des Rentiers

**Street parking** 

Street parking is possible, and you can pay using the PayByPhone app. The price is €8 for 2 hours (you can pay remotely while visiting Paris). The daily cost is €40.

**Electric car**

If you have an electric car, street parking is free, but with restrictions !
Please visit the paris website for details.

**Tickets and fines**

Please note, the automatic fine process is extremely efficient in Paris (special cars with cameras issue automatic fines that you receive later). They cost €50 per day, so very close to the daily parking cost.

I hope this helps.
