        <h2>Private Parking</h2>

        <h3>Zenpark</h3>
        <p>Visit <a href="https://zenpark.com/" target="_blank">Zenpark</a>, a website where you can rent a private parking space for a few days.  
        They have many parking spaces throughout Paris, and some spots are available just a few streets away from our house.  
        (5 minutes walk, at the corner of Rue du Château des Rentiers and Rue Marcel Duchamp).</p>

        <p>The cost is approximately €20 per day, and it's probably the best option. You enter the parking with their application.</p>

        <p><strong>I recommend their parking at 46 Rue du Château des Rentiers.</strong></p>

        <h2>Street Parking</h2>
        <p>Street parking is possible, and you can pay using the PayByPhone app. The price is €8 for 2 hours, but goes up the longer you stay. The price can also be prohibitive for SUVs.</p>

        <h2>Electric Cars</h2>
        <p>If you have an electric car, street parking is free, but many restrictions apply!  
        Please visit the Paris city website for details.</p>

        <h2>Tickets and Fines</h2>
        <p>The automatic fine process is extremely efficient in Paris (special cars with cameras issue automatic fines that you receive later). Beware...</p>

        <p>I hope this helps.</p>

        <p>Best regards,</p>
