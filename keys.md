# Keys
Your first set of keys is in the keybox and there is a second set on the small round table by the in the living room. 

Letâ€™s identify them: three are similar and have colored rings, while one is different.


## Key - no colored ring ##

**The key without a colored ring opens the front gate.**

## <span style="color:blue;">Key - blue ring</span> ##

**This key opens the living room and kitchen doors.**

## <span style="color:purple;">Key - purple ring</span> ##

**The purple key opens the downstairs bedroom.**

## <span style="color:green;">Key - green ring</span> ##

**The green key opens both upstairs doors (bedrooms and bathroom).**

## Enter the living room ##

To enter, use the blue key to unlock the living room door. On the small table inside, youâ€™ll find the second set of keysâ€”welcome home!

## Key Tips ##

To lock and unlock the living room door, pull it firmly towards you and lift the handle up before turning the key.

The same applies to the kitchen door and the downstairs bedroom door.

Upstairs doors do not require lifting the handle to lock them.

To open the front gate from outside, turn the key twice.

Enjoy your stay! ðŸ˜Š
